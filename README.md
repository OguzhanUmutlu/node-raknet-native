# node-raknet-native
Native RakNet bindings for Node.js

## Install

```sh
npm install raknet-native
```

Prebuilds are provided for 64-bit Windows 10, Linux and macOS Catalina. If a prebuild does not work, create an issue and set enviornment variable FORCE_BUILD to force a manual build.

See [#Usage](#Usage) below.

## Build
If cloning from git, you must clone the repository recursively. 

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/extremeheat/node-raknet-native.git && cd node-raknet-native
npm install
```
### Build on mac

You need to install xcode utilities first:

```
xcode-select --install
```

## Usage

#### class Client, Server

The Client and Server classes are JS wrappers around the internal RakClient and RakServer classes implemented in C++ in src/. See the ts/RakNet.js for usage.

#### Example

A simple generic RakNet example:

```ts
const { Client, Server, PacketPriority, PacketReliability } = require('raknet-native')
// The third paramater is for game type, you can specify 'minecraft' or leave it blank for generic RakNet
const client = new Client('127.0.0.1', 19130)
// hostname, port, serverOptions
const server = new Server('0.0.0.0', 19130, { maxConnections: 3 })
server.listen()
client.connect()
client.on('encapsulated', (buffer) => {
  console.assert(buffer.toString() == '\xA0 Hello world')
})

server.on('openConnection', (client) => {
  client.send(Buffer.from('\xA0 Hello world'), PacketPriority.HIGH_PRIORITY, PacketReliability.UNRELIABLE, 0)
})
```

For example, for Minecraft Bedrock, use:
```ts
const { Client, Server, PacketPriority, MCPingMessage } = require('raknet-native')
const client = new Client('127.0.0.1', 19130, { protocolVersion: 10 })
const server = new Server('0.0.0.0', 19130, { protocolVersion: 10, maxConnections: 3, message: new MCPingMessage().toString()  })
```

For more usage examples see tests/.
